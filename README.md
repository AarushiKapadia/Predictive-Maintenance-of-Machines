<u><h2>Project Overview</h2></u>

Analyzing historic data, this project aims to leverage ML and Data Visualization skills to visualize and analyze trends and relationship between various factors that affect the performance of a machine. With large and diverse data samples, Microsoft Azure Predictive Maintenance dataset allows for robust model training and evaluation.
    
Key Features:

1. Data Visualization and Exploration: Data visualization techniques were employed to present historical data in an accessible and insightful manner. This facilitates the exploration of data trends, patterns, and correlations, enabling a deeper understanding of the factors impacting machinery performance.

2. Dynamic Front-End: An intuitive front-end interface that allows users to interact with and see the failure trend for individual machine. 

3. Model Building: Leveraging a suite of machine learning models, including Random Forest, Support Vector Classifier (SVC), Logistic Regression, and CATBOOST, we have achieved remarkable accuracy rates of up to 99% in predicting machine failures. These models enable proactive maintenance planning, reducing downtime and operational costs.

4. Custom Input Testing: Users have the flexibility to input specific machine attributes such as pressure, voltage, rotation, and vibration. The predictive models process this input to deliver instant assessments of whether a machine is likely to fail or not.

<h2>What is the issue that industries are facing and how our project aims to provide solutions for them?
</h2> 
</hr>

The maintenance of machines poses significant challenges, leading to frequent breakdowns, decreased productivity, increased downtime, and higher costs.
There are 4 main maintenance strategies such as:
- Reactive maintenance,
- Periodic maintenance,
- Proactive/Preventive maintenance and 
- Predictive maintenance
The industry still focuses on Reactive, Periodic and Proactive maintenance instead of predictive maintenance.

<u><h3>Project Objective:</h3></u>
The project's core objective is to revolutionize maintenance practices. Hence, we leverage data to:

1. Predict Failures: Identify potential machine failures in advance.
2. Issue Early Warnings: Provide actionable insights to prevent unexpected downtime.
3. Enhance Reliability: Minimize costly and unplanned failures.

In essence, we're transforming maintenance from reactive to proactive, saving time and resources while boosting operational efficiency.
